# 0x04. TypeScript

This project introduces the basics and advanced features of TypeScript in frontend JavaScript development. You‚Äôll learn how to define interfaces, classes, namespaces, and interact with configuration files like `tsconfig.json` and `webpack.config.js`.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand basic and advanced TypeScript types
- Define and implement interfaces
- Use namespaces and declaration merging
- Configure TypeScript compilation using Webpack
- Work with branded types for type safety
- Interact with external JS files using ambient type declarations

---

## üìÅ Tasks Summary

### ‚úÖ Task 0: Creating an Interface for a Student

- Created an interface `Student` with fields: `firstName`, `lastName`, `age`, and `location`.
- Rendered an HTML table using TypeScript that displays student names and locations.
- Validated that Webpack compiles without any type errors.

---

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Extending Interfaces and Creating Classes

- Defined a `Teacher` interface with readonly fields and optional attributes.
- Used index signatures to allow additional properties (like `contract`).
- Created a `Directors` interface that extends `Teacher`.
- Created a `StudentClass` with methods and described it via an interface.

---

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Implementing Interfaces with Classes

- Created `DirectorInterface` and `TeacherInterface`.
- Implemented `Director` and `Teacher` classes based on the interfaces.
- Built a `createEmployee` function that returns a `Director` or `Teacher` based on salary type and value.

---

### ‚úÖ Task 3: Ambient Declarations and Module Interoperability

- Created type definitions for `crud.js` using an ambient `crud.d.ts` file.
- Defined types `RowID` and `RowElement` in `interface.ts`.
- Used TypeScript to call and validate `insertRow`, `updateRow`, and `deleteRow`.

---

### ‚úÖ Task 4: Namespaces and Subject Classes

- Used namespaces to define `Teacher` interface and multiple subjects: `Cpp`, `Java`, `React`.
- Used declaration merging to add optional teaching experience fields.
- Each subject class implements `getRequirements()` and `getAvailableTeacher()`.
- Demonstrated usage by logging outputs for each subject with a sample teacher.

---

### ‚úÖ Task 5: Branded Types with Major and Minor Credits

- Defined `MajorCredits` and `MinorCredits` interfaces using branding (`__brand`) for type safety.
- Implemented `sumMajorCredits()` and `sumMinorCredits()` functions that accept and return properly typed values.
